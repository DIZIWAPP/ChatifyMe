ChatifyMe
=========
This is simple native iPhone Chat App.

It uses beautiful iOS 7 custom transition between view controllers for more information:

The app works well on iOS 7 and 3.5" screen as far now. I am working on making it bug free across the OS and Screen sizes. 

The application uses Parse for data and Scringo framework for chat interface.

You can test the app using test account - test username and password.
